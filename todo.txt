add template with base code:
  io
  some basic interfaces:
    ..., 
    comparator1(Less), 
    comparator2(Less,Equal),
    comparator3(Less,Equal,Greater)
  some basic functions:
    min, max, abs, sum, alowerBound, upperBound, etc
  some basic ds:
    pair, triple, set, etc


now, everything will be grouped:

DS:
  segtree
  queue
  deque
  priority queue
  convex hull
  online convex hull (with either sets or lichao)
